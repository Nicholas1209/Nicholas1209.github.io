			<h1>About <span class="orange">Me</span></h1>
			<p> I'm excited to share a little bit about myself with you.
			  I was born in <span class="orange">Shenzhen, China,</span> as the son of a German father and
			  and a Chinese mother.&nbsp;</p>
			<p>&nbsp; <br>
			  At the age of 8, my mother and I moved to a <span class="orange">small town in Germany</span>,
			  called Diez to reunite with my father. </p>
			  <p> <br>
				  I graduated from a German high school, in which I <span class="orange">majored in English
				  and Mathematics</span> in 2018, after which I decided to pursue my
				  post-secondary education in the United States, as I was always
				  fascinated by American culture and the close-knit nature of
				  American college campuses.&nbsp;</p>
			      <p>&nbsp; <br>
				  At <span class="orange">California State University Monterey Bay</span>, I majored 
				  in <span class="orange">Business Administration with a concentration in Information Systems</span>.
				  So far, I've learned valuable skills in SQL, Python, and R, that I am eager to apply to real-life projects. <br>
				  I graduated in May 2023 with honors - Magna Cum Laude.&nbsp;</p>
				  <p>&nbsp; <br>
				  Five years from now, I see myself in a <span class="orange">Data Scientist</span> position.
				  <br>
				  At CSUMB, where the responsible aspect of doing business is heavily emphasized 
				  through the Quintuple Bottom Line, Iâ€™ve learned that <span class="orange">stockholder value is not the
				  ultimate goal.</span> I am eager to leverage my econometric analysis, statistical modeling, and data interpretation skills to address complex economic questions, make a meaningful impact on society, and <span class="orange">transform the status quo of society into something more positive.</span> </p>
